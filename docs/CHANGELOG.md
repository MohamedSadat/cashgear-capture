# Changelog

Each phase lists the features added, how it was tested, and known limitations.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold (2026-10-14)

### Added
- Solution `CashGear.Capture.sln`: Core (`net10.0`, no WPF/WinRT), Interop, Engine, Editor and Recording placeholders, WPF App, three test projects (xUnit v3 on Microsoft.Testing.Platform + AwesomeAssertions). Central package management; one Windows TFM property (`net10.0-windows10.0.22621.0`, minimum 10.0.19041).
- `app.manifest` with PerMonitorV2 DPI awareness; startup self-check logs the thread's DPI context.
- Generic host + DI + Serilog (`%LocalAppData%\CashGear\Capture\logs\capture-yyyyMMdd.log`, 14 days, shared between processes).
- `JsonSettingsService` (`%AppData%\CashGear\Capture\settings.json`): defaults on first run, lenient parsing, clamping, atomic writes, corrupt files backed up as `settings.json.corrupt-<timestamp>`.
- Tray icon (H.NotifyIcon, efficiency mode off) with Capture Region / Capture Window / Capture Full Screen / Settings… / Exit. Settings… opens the JSON file in Notepad until the settings window lands (Phase 4).
- Single instance: per-user/session named mutex; later launches forward a command over a current-user-only named pipe (`activate`, `--exit`, `--capture-fullscreen`) and exit.
- Core building blocks used by later phases: physical-pixel geometry, DPI math, pooled `CapturedImage`, row copy/compositing helpers, hotkey types.

### Tested
- 80 Core unit tests (geometry incl. negative coordinates, DPI rounding, row-pitch copies, compositing, image pooling, settings round-trip/corruption/concurrency, command parsing).
- Manual: launch → one process, tray icon created, log written; second launch exits 0 and the first instance logs `Activate`; `--exit` shuts the instance down in < 1 s with "Shutdown complete" logged; defaults written to settings.json.

### Known limitations
- Capture Region / Capture Window show a "coming in Phase 2/3" notification.
- Tray icon is generated from text ("CG"); no designed icon yet.
